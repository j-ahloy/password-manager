# Password Manager

This is a simple password manager built as a final project for CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It probably shouldn't be used, given the security risks invovled. But if one would like to, below is how to get it working.

## Set-up

Create a virtual environment and activate it: 
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
