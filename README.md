# Password Manager

This is a simple password manager built as a final project for CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It probably shouldn't be used, given the security risks invovled. But if one would like to, below is how to get it working.

## Set-up

Create a virtual environment and activate it: 

    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate

(env) should now be visible before your command prompt. Use the command `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment at any time. 

Install requirements:

    pip install -U pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
 
## Usage

Once the virtual environment is active, enter
    
    python3 manage.py runserver

to run the application locally.
